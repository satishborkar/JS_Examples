## Why JS need
    - DOM / BOM Manupulations
    - Client Validations
    - Multi Threading in JS,  SSE Server Sent Events [Background /Web Workers]

## JS check dataType on runtime not on compile time. which is why JS dynamic language.


## Creating Scopes in JS ES 5 
    - Functions
    - IIFE
    - Namesspace
    - Closure

## In ES6 
    - LET
    - CONST
        - they are not get hoisted,
        - they can not be declare again.
        - they have blocked scoped.  

## Hoisting
    -  JavaSript during compilation process pickup/ hoist all variable declatation & functionName declaration are placed in the memory

## in JS all function arguments / parameters are optionals

## Arrow functions/ Fat Arrow functions / Lymbda Functions;


## Spread ... its operator & copy the enumurable properties.
## Rest ... Pack all parameters in a single Array.


## Arrow function 
    - does not hold its own arguments object like normal function.
    - can not be used as contructor function.
    - does not hold its own lexical scope.


## Classes
    - We use contructor function to define class.
    - To differentoate it from normal function we use CapitalCamelCasing.
    - by using this keyword we declare public methods & 
        parametes where as with var we declare private methods & paraments.
    - function as class it is created window scope classes as class created in local scope..


## Promises
    - Disadvantage
        - Promise always return you single value.
        - Does not work on publisher and subcriber pattern.
        - Promises once initiated are not cancelable.
        
    - Advantages

##RXJS
    - Does overcome all disadvantages of Promises.


ITERATOR:
    - iterator is an object which does not maintain its state, developer have to maintain its state.

GENERATOR:
    - Generator maintain their own state.
