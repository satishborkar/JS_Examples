# Problem Solving Notes:

    - Whenever wanted to persist some value throughout the function store 
        in a var of function scope and update it whenever needed.
        like timer in stopwatch example.
        We can consider every function as global for all inner functions/operations and make use it like window object.

    - While doing operations on mix data like array, object. depending on the output type
        consider the basic methods to do so and convert rest in that format.
        like sumOfAllDeptSalary function which is recursive function example.
