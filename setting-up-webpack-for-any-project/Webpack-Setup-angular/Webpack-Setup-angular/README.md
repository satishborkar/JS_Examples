# Webpack-Setup
An ideal project setup for any project using Webpack

Note: 
All features are incrementally included on the `angular` branch. Use the `dashboard` branch to see the implementation of `webpack-dashboard`.

Create a `.env` file in the root folder with:

for `angular` branch
```
API_KEY=1234567890
APP_ENV=prod
```

for `dashboard` branch
```
API_KEY=1234567890
APP_ENV=dev
```

Setup.

```sh
$ yarn
$ yarn start
```
